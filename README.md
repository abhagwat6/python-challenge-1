Ordering Menu for a Restaurant
## **Goal**
### This program allows customers in a restaurant to order items from the menu.   
## **How does it work?**
#### The program asks customers a series of questions, such as: 
##### What would you like to order from the main categories?
##### What specific food would you like to order from the sub-categories?  
##### Quantity?
##### Ask if anything else to order? 
##### If "no", then prepares the itemized bill.

### The code was developed by using the starter file.
